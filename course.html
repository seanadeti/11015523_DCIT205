                    <p>
                        The Department of Computer Science - University of Ghana 
                        currently runs Masters of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.)
                        in Computer Science.
                        The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) programme with a capstone project while 
                        the MPhil is a 2-year (full-time) programme. The first year of the MPhil is taught 
                        course and second year is research and dissertation. Both programmes are accelerated master's programme 
                        specially designed to train current and future computer scientist who are available for full-time or part-time 
                        study.
                        Students enrolled in these programmes are equipped with broader knowledge in theoretical computer 
                        science and advance technical skills to approach science in technology as a disruptive force to manage 
                        complex problems of the global society. At the end of these programmes, students will gain hands-on experience 
                        in solving complex, and unstructured scientific problems while learning subjects like Advance Databases, 
                        Advance Data Structures and Algorithms and Networks

                    <p>
                        Our doctoral programme is a full-time research programme with expected duration of 4-years. 
                        For the successful completion of this programme, a high level of commitment is required.
                        Students are therefore expected to reside close to the University and be a 
                        full-time participant in the program. With guidance from postgraduate committee, Ph.D. 
                        students will create a personalized program of study that includes a major area of specialization 
                        and at least two minor areas of specialization.
                        In addition to coursework, the department holds regular seminars where students 
                        and faculty review and critique research in the field. To foster prudent critique, 
                        students are expected to join at most one research lab and participate in research activities 
                        carried out by the group. The research areas of the department are Intelligent Space and Machine Learning, 
                        Data Science/Big Data Analytics, Networking and Communications Engineering, and Cyber Security

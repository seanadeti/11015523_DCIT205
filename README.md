## WHAT I LEARNT FROM THE PROJECT

Building this project involves combining HTML and CSS to create a static webpage. Through this project, I have gained experience in:
1. HTML Structure: Understanding how to structure HTML for a webpage, including headers, sections, and footers.
2. CSS Styling: Applying styles to HTML elements to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.
3. Design Principles: Learning about design principles such as color schemes, typography, and spacing to create a cohesive look.
4. Project Organization: Structuring your project with clear sections (HTML, CSS) and maintaining a clean codebase.
